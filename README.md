# Assessing the Effect of an Antitumor Drug From Preclinical Models Through Advanced Data Analysis

This repository contains the code necessary to replicate the study carried out in the thesis "ASSESSING THE EFFECT OF AN ANTITUMOR DRUG FROM PRECLINICAL MODELS THROUGH ADVANCED DATA ANALYSIS".

## Description

The aim of this study is to analyze how temozolomide (TMZ) treatment affects mouse models of glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To this end, several Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and transfer learning techniques have been implemented to classify between treated and untreated mice.

## Instructions

Open the notebook and modify the paths to the downloaded data. The paths to modify are found in the Control Images and Treated Images sections of the notebook.

- ruta_MRI = "path/to/your/MRI/images/folder"
- ruta_mask = "path/to/your/mask/images/folder"
